Problem Statement:
Title: Loan Default Predic1on and Evalua1on Criteria
Background: For ﬁnancial ins1tu1ons, the ability to predict loan defaults is a cri1cal factor
in managing ﬁnancial risk, maintaining proﬁtability, and ensuring sustainable growth.
Defaulted loans can signiﬁcantly disrupt the ﬁnancial health of an ins1tu1on, as they lead to
substan1al losses and may poten1ally aﬀect the ins1tu1on's credibility. Tradi1onal risk
assessment methods, which largely rely on a borrower's credit score, income, and collateral,
have not been en1rely eﬃcient in predic1ng loan defaults. This ineﬃciency could be
aFributed to their inability to capture complex paFerns and rela1onships in the data,
thereby necessita1ng a more advanced approach.
Problem: The candidate needs to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaul1ng on a loan
using a machine learning model. This model should consider a variety of factors that
poten1ally inﬂuence a borrower's ability to repay a loan, such as income, employment
status, credit score, loan amount, interest rate, and other relevant variables. The predic1on
model should also handle data imbalances, missing values, and outliers eﬀec1vely.
Second, the ability to address the problem, including the understanding of the problem, the
proposed solu1on, the ability to build a predic1ve model, and the understanding of machine
learning algorithms, data analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering, and model
evalua1on methods.
In terms of the data science interview, the evalua1on criteria should encompass the
following:
§ Problem Understanding: The candidate's understanding of the loan default
predic1on problem.
§ Proposed Solu4on: Their proposed approach to solve the problem, includes data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model selec1on, and model training.
§ Model Development: The candidate's ability to develop a predic1ve model, including
handling imbalanced data, missing values, and outliers.
§ Model Evalua4on: Their understanding of various model evalua1on metrics relevant
to the problem, such as precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC, etc.
§ Knowledge and Experience: Their understanding of machine learning algorithms,
data analysis, and other relevant areas.

§ How do you perform canary build?
§ What should be the strategy for ML Model Monitoring?
§ How do you perform load and stress tes1ng?
§ How do you track, monitor and audit ML training?
